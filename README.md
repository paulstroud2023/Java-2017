## Java-2017
This repo contains Java code from two coding classes I took in 2017.

The two main projects for these classes were:
1. Creating a simple calendar in an iterative/Agile fashion, progressively adding functionality
2. Creating a Java program that incorporates classes, properties, methods, and inheritance
